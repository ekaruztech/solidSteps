However, we need to state that our decision to invest and launch into education was never borne from any imagination for golden fleece but the sheer and innate passion to empower mankind; using education as a veritable tool. It took us over five years to conduct effective research both at home and overseas, to appraise the intricacies inherent in educational investment, management and administration. Similarly, all necessary legal requirements were complied with prior to commencement of operation, such as registration with the Corporate Affairs Commission, name search and approval with the Lagos State Ministry of Education, among others. Over the years a lot has changed for but one thing has remained consistent: a focus on helping your child discover and develop their unique talents within a disciplined and caring environment.</p>\r\n[/fullwidth_text] [spb_row wrap_type="content-width" row_bg_type="color" row_bg_color="#faebd7" color_row_height="content-height" bg_type="cover" parallax_image_height="content-height" parallax_image_movement="fixed" parallax_image_speed="0.5" parallax_video_height="window-height" parallax_video_overlay="none" row_overlay_opacity="0" row_padding_vertical="65" row_padding_horizontal="4" row_margin_vertical="0" remove_element_spacing="no" inner_column_height="col-natural" row_el_class="row-color" width="1/1" el_position="first last"] [spb_icon_box title="SCHOOL MOTTO" box_type="standard" character="A" color="accent" target="_self" animation="none" animation_delay="0" width="1/3" el_position="first"]\r\n\r\n<strong style="color: #000; font-size: 16px;">Taking Solid Steps into academic success with the home zone advantage.</strong>\r\n\r\n[/spb_icon_box] [spb_icon_box title="MISSION STATEMENT" box_type="standard" character="B" color="accent" target="_self" animation="none" animation_delay="0" width="1/3"]\r\n\r\n<strong style="color: #000; font-size: 16px;">To assert that academic excellence and glory can be achieved without malpractice.</strong>\r\n\r\n[/spb_icon_box] [spb_icon_box title="OUR VISION" box_type="standard" character="C" color="accent" target="_self" animation="none" animation_delay="0" width="1/3" el_position="last"]\r\n\r\n<strong style="color: #000; font-size: 16px;">To raise leaders and champions that would create positive and noticeable difference in the society.</strong>\r\n\r\n[/spb_icon_box] [/spb_row] [blank_spacer height="30px" width="1/1" el_position="first last"] [spb_text_block title="OUR SCHOOL CHARACTER &amp; UNIFORMS" pb_margin_bottom="no" pb_border_bottom="no" width="1/2" el_position="first"]\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">The uniform reflects the school character and greatly contributes to a child’s sense of belonging and pride in their school.

Our school is advantageously located occupying wide expanse of land. It is flanked by the Diamond Estate on the south pole, the Greenland Estate on the east pole, the Governor Road that connects the Alimosho Local Government Council Headquarters at Ikotun on the west pole and Ikotun-Egbeda Road on the north pole. It has easy access and link from the LASU-Isheri Road through Odo-Eran Bus Stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Establishment History</h4>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 16px;">The school formally began operations on 5th August 2013 during the summer coaching; which was used to successfully test run our entire plant and facilities. However, we need to state that our decision to invest and launch into education was never borne from any imagination for golden fleece but the sheer and innate passion to empower mankind; using education as a veritable tool. It took us over five years to conduct effective research both at home and overseas, to appraise the intricacies inherent in educational investment, management and administration. Similarly, all necessary legal requirements were complied with prior to commencement of operation, such as registration with the Corporate Affairs Commission, name search and approval with the Lagos State Ministry of Education, among others. Over the years a lot has changed for but one thing has remained consistent: a focus on helping your child discover and develop their unique talents within a disciplined and caring environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>School Motto</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Taking Solid Steps into academic success with the home zone advantage.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h4>Mission Statement</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">To assert that academic excellence and glory can be achieved without malpractice.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h4>Our Vision</h4>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">To raise leaders and champions that would create positive and noticeable difference in the society.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n[/fullwidth_text]', 'About Us', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '12023-revision-v1', '', '', '2015-09-02 14:40:27', '2015-09-02 14:40:27', '', 12023, 'http://localhost/mine/SolidSteps/2015/09/02/12023-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

However, we need to state that our decision to invest and launch into education was never borne from any imagination for golden fleece but the sheer and innate passion to empower mankind; using education as a veritable tool. It took us over five years to conduct effective research both at home and overseas, to appraise the intricacies inherent in educational investment, management and administration. Similarly, all necessary legal requirements were complied with prior to commencement of operation, such as registration with the Corporate Affairs Commission, name search and approval with the Lagos State Ministry of Education, among others.
